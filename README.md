# My Website

![Cover Image](formStep.jpg)

Welcome to my website! This project is a demonstration of a simple, responsive website built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design is clean and intuitive, making it easy for users to navigate.

## Introduction

This website is a showcase of my skills in front-end web development. It's built from scratch using pure JavaScript, without any frameworks or libraries. This approach gives me complete control over the functionality and appearance of the website.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: The structure of the website is defined using simple, semantic HTML.
- **CSS**: The website's styles, including its responsive design, are implemented in CSS. The design uses the Lato font from Google Fonts for a modern, readable appearance.
- **JavaScript**: All of the website's interactivity is powered by JavaScript. This includes form validation, navigation, and more.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file. It includes the basic structure of the website and links to the CSS and JS files. It also links to the Lato font from Google Fonts.
- `css/style.css`: This is the main CSS file. It includes styles for making the website responsive and uses the Lato font.
- `js/script.js`: This is the main JS file. It includes any interactive functionality for the website.

## How to Use

To use this project, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The CSS and JS files are linked in the HTML, so they will automatically load when you open the HTML file.

## Note

Please ensure that you have an active internet connection when you open the website, as the Lato font is loaded from Google Fonts.
