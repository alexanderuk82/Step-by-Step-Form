# My Website

This is a simple, responsive website that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website uses the Lato font from Google Fonts.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file. It includes the basic structure of the website and links to the CSS and JS files. It also links to the Lato font from Google Fonts.
- `css/style.css`: This is the main CSS file. It includes styles for making the website responsive and uses the Lato font.
- `js/script.js`: This is the main JS file. It includes any interactive functionality for the website.

## How to Use

To use this project, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The CSS and JS files are linked in the HTML, so they will automatically load when you open the HTML file.

## Note

Please ensure that you have an active internet connection when you open the website, as the Lato font is loaded from Google Fonts.
